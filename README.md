# DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The moonquake visualizer aims to help researchers identify where recorded quakes have occurred all over the moon.

We aimed to give the most value to the data and create a UI able to showcase its worth to the user. The user is able to
select from 3 different datasets and see the location, recorded date, and other information that came with its dataset.
